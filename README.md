This repo contains my submission for BLockchain Division PS of IITI GDSC club
All the files related to the project Have been uploaded.
I named the token CodeFund(CDF) with tocken contract address - 0x0DF6fdfd4c803AAF65a114c58c562e716976e17d
Repo contains CodeFund.sol file containing solidity code for the token, CodeFund.js file which was used to test it before deployment in terms of transaction being processed within wallet balance and so on.
It also contains deploy.js and hardhat.config.js which were used to deploy it along with a .env file containing key and Infura endpoint.
The repo also contains Three screen shots. First one shows the CDF token in my metamask account which after some transactions is 67M. Second one shows the screen shot of my friend's account to which I transferred few million of my token(EDF). Third screen shot shows my token and it's recent transactions on etherscan.io
The project was Overall a good experience to learn in depth about blockchain technology.
